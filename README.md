# Final Project
 Plotting Efficiency and Endurance

FinalProjectEff and funFinalProjectEff contain the code for the Efficiency Plot.
Similarly, FinalProjectEnd and funFinalProjectEnd contain the code for the Endurance Plot.

Creating the Endurance plot was much simpler, as I didn't need to make so many arrays for the data. I left comments throughout my codes that should be able to explain my math and reasoning.
