# Final Project
 Plotting Efficiency and Endurance

FinalProjectEff and funFinalProjectEff contain the code for the Efficiency Plot.
Similarly, FinalProjectEnd and funFinalProjectEnd contain the code for the Endurance Plot.

I left comments throughout my codes that should be able to explain my math and reasoning. The comments also define any variables or coefficients used.
